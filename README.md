# WiZ-Light-Control
Control your WiZ Lights from your computer. Comes with Frequency and Volume Audio visualizers.


Currently the Audio visualizers do not work correctly when opened from the main program's gui. If you wish to use the visualizers please use the .exe's located in the installed folder. The Visualizer's names are config_gui.exe for the Frequency visualizer and volume_config_gui.exe for the Volume visualier. You can also download and install the visualizers as standalone programs from my Github.
